1. Soay IBM

  - Normally sheep get 1 lamb/reproductive individual/year
  
  - These are re-distributed using a high DF Chi-square or low DF Chi-square
  
  - Low df produces higher gini coefficients
  
  
2. Next step is to feed the re-distributed lambs back into each time step.

  - Extend simulations to compute final population size/$\lambda_s$ with 1000 different initial conditions to explore population trajectories as a function of Gini (3 levels of inequality - low, medium, high).
  
  - Compare fate distributions across levels of inequality and figure something out from there.
