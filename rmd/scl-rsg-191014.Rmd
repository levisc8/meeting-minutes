1. Overview of south africa work
    
    + Things went well - all sites resampled
    
    + 3/6 finished digitization, just need to get the others done 
    to fit models
    
    + Seedling resampling went well. Recovered 2/3 plots and have polygons for
    surviving ones
    
2. Ground truthing

    + Use some targets of known sizes (e.g. cardboard) for this
    
    + plant them along the elevational gradient and try to get as much space
    as possible as well to capture pixel size variance
    
    + relation to DSM??
    
3. Israel paper

    + Keep rob posted on Ana's progress. I don't think we need anything else
    from him though (except maybe another round of comments)

4. Pollen Lim paper

    + SCL needs to derive $L_a$ and $L_a_\omega$ 
    
    + Use 0.05 threshold for `pb_z()` to compute $\pi_0$ and see what that yields.
    
    + Possibly need smaller values
